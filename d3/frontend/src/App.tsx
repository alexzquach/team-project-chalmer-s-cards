						Chalmerâ€™s vision is a project facilitated by Zachary Donsky as one of two ways 
						to improve the functioning of shelters. Part of a shelters requirements is to 
						always track the occupancy of the building to keep the number of people within 
						fire code specifications. When a shelter reaches full capacity, clients who 
						unfortunately seek refuge in these shelters need to be deferred to another. 
						This project looks to aid this process by providing a simple solution; a 
						counter that streamlines the process of counting the flow of people in a 
						building. This information is then readily available to other shelters so 
						clients can go to vacant shelters quickly.{" "}
