							Chalmerâ€™s Vision is a project facilitated by Zachary Donsky as one
							of two ways to improve the functioning of shelters. Part of a
							shelters requirements is to always track the occupancy of the
							building to keep the number of people within fire code
							specifications. When a shelter reaches full capacity, clients who
							unfortunately seek refuge in these shelters need to be deferred to
							another. This project looks to aid this process by providing a
							simple solution; a counter that streamlines the process of
							counting the flow of people in a building. This information is
							then readily available to other shelters so clients can go to
							vacant shelters quickly.{" "}
