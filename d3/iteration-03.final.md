# Chalmers Vision - Team 700 IQ

## Iteration 3/4

 * Start date: Friday, November 15, 2019
 * End date: Sunday, December 1, 2019

### Changes from you `product.md`

List the most significant changes you made to your product (if any). It's normal to change features mid-project or reduce the scope to meet timelines. 

 * Start with the most significant change
 * Identify either a change in features or a reduction of your original scope
 * For each change, explain why you are making it and what you are hoping to achieve from it

 > *Note:* If you are not making (or haven't made) any changes to your product, it means you successfully scoped, planned and executed the development of your application.This is a very rare occurrence - describe what you believed enabled your team to do so and why. 

### Handoff plan
To handoff our product, we will attempt to schedule a handoff meeting for Thursday, December 5th, 2019 (As we already do have weekly meetings on Thursdays) with our partner.  During the meeting, we will discuss what will be done with the repository we have setup for class with our partner and what the next steps for the product are.  Since this is an open source project, we will most likely discuss how to transfer all of our work to our partner's more public repository for Chalmer's Vision and IF he would even like us to transfer all of our work over.  The assets we are actually handing off to our partner will be our entire github codebase for the semester, demonstration videos that we filmed, demonstration website that we created and instructions on github on how to run the application we have built on his local machine.  Since our partner has a technical background, he will have the technical capacity to manage, maintain and develop additional extensions for our product.  This will make the handoff much easier as he is already familiar with the work we have done and he is familiar with the github workflow.  We will hand off these assets during the meeting either through github, email transfer, slack file transfer, and/or USB transfer.
