# Chalmers Vision - Team 700 IQ

## Iteration 3/4

 * Start date: Friday, November 15, 2019
 * End date: Sunday, December 1, 2019

### Changes from you `product.md`
1) The most significant change we have made to our product was the final delivery of information to the user of our product.  In our original plan, we said we'd provide a JSON document of shelter occupancy (per shelter) but since our product has imperfections with regards to counting accuracy, we decided to just demonstrate a live counter on each product and give our product frameworks.   The occupancy can still however be quickly calculated with total in minus total out to give our total occupancy counter.  We hoped to achieve a more simple way of displaying shelter occupancy count with this change.  We also chose to do it like this in order to meet timelines specified by the partner.
2) Another minor change we have is the data being provided to other users of the product.  Since we did not have a JSON document of shelter occupancy, we could not implement this minor feature and ended up dropping it.  This was just a reduction of our original scope

*Note*: We did successfully implement our front-end application showcasing our various models !

### Handoff plan
To handoff our product, we will attempt to schedule a handoff meeting for Thursday, December 5th, 2019 (As we already do have weekly meetings on Thursdays) with our partner.  During the meeting, we will discuss what will be done with the repository we have setup for class with our partner and what the next steps for the product are.  Since this is an open source project, we will most likely discuss how to transfer all of our work to our partner's more public repository for Chalmer's Vision and IF he would even like us to transfer all of our work over.  The assets we are actually handing off to our partner will be our entire github codebase for the semester, demonstration videos that we filmed, demonstration website that we created and instructions on github on how to run the application we have built on his local machine.  Since our partner has a technical background, he will have the technical capacity to manage, maintain and develop additional extensions for our product.  This will make the handoff much easier as he is already familiar with the work we have done and he is familiar with the github workflow.  We will hand off these assets during the meeting either through github, email transfer, slack file transfer, and/or USB transfer.
