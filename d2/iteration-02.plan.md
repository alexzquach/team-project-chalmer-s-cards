### Team Rules
#### Communications
* As a team, we will meet on Thursdays after 3:00 PM before the meeting with Zach at school (Bahen).  After this meeting as a team, we will meet our project partner.
 * We will be meeting with our project partner weekly on Thursdays at 5:30 pm at a pre-arranged location for the week that will be decided over slack or email with the project partner.
     * Meetings alternate every week with one week in person and one week online through Slack/Discord
     * For the online meeting, the application will be decided on Slack beforehand.
 * Our process for communicating with our partner involves talking over slack during the week and during our weekly meetings on Thursday.  On Thursday, we will talk about our progress, our next steps and what requirements we need from him (Update our partner on the progress).  During the week, we will message him on Slack if anything is needed.
----
#### Meetings
 * The SCRUM Master / AGILE coach will keep track of each member's attendance and missed meeting catch up, acting as the moderator of the meetings.
 * If a member cannot attend, they will have to provide a reason why they could not attend, and the steps they'll take to get up to speed on what they missed in the meeting. The partner(s) of the absentee will then be responsible for filling in the individual on what happened in the meeting.
 * Partners will send meeting delegates, attending by proxy if they are absent.
 * If a person misses 2 meetings without exceptional circumstances and/or misses 2 action items deadlines (milestones), further escalation will be taken (explained below in conflict resolution).
----
#### Conflict Resolution

*Scenarios*
1) Refusing to communicate
     * In this scenario, the group will attempt to confront the person(s) in person and try to resolve why there is a lack of communication in a respectful manner.  If we cannot resolve it in person, we will go to the course administrator for further action.
2) Missed milestone
     * In the scenario, we will call a snap group meeting and try to figure out why it is going on, and to determine why the milestone was missed if they need any help and if the milestone is within the persons' scope.  If we cannot resolve this, we can decide to tackle the missed milestone as a group, or we will go to the course administrator for further action.
3) Difference in progress between groups
     * In this scenario, the groups that are ahead can decide to help the groups behind.  If it is an issue, we can redistribute the work and assign people to help out the groups that are behind.
4) One member is being too controlling
     * In this scenario, the other members of the group should respectfully discuss the dynamic with the person.  If the behavior is consistent, the problem will be escalated to the course administration.
5) Two group members have personal issues between each other
     * In this scenario, the rest of the group / SCRUM master should act as a mediator and try to find the resolution.  If a resolution cannot be reached, the scrum master will act as the arbitrator.  If there is a conflict of interest, course administration will be brought in.
6) All groups experience significant setbacks or show a lack of progress
     * For this case, a discussion should be initiated as soon as possible to discuss a change in scope relating to the work. We will look to see if we can merge groups and requirements to ensure something is delivered such as creating fewer models.  If this cannot be resolved, we will either discuss it with the administration or change the MVP of the project.

#### Partner Meetings
You must have at least 2 meetings with your project partner - an initial planning meeting and a document review meeting. Describe the meetings here:

*Meeting #1*
* When and where
    * Was on Thursday, October 10th, 2019, and at the Bampot Tea House on Bathurst and Harbord. The meeting was approximately 2 hours in length. 
* What we discussed during the meeting
    * The schedule for the meeting was as follows:
    * Introductions with everyone and insight into the Chalmer's history and goals.
    * Discussed possible meeting schedules and structure of each meeting that aligns with the partner's schedule.
    * Asked questions related to what the project will be about and what the project specifies. We also asked questions to properly cast the project in terms of action goals and deliverables as discussed in the course.
    * Discussed the tech stack of the project pros and cons of possible implementations and general plans of actions.
* The outcomes of the meeting
    * Finalized our method of communication with the partner and group. That being mainly slack and email.
    * Scheduled our next meeting with our partner (will occur on Thursday afternoon). We also finalized our schedule by meeting the partner on Sunday or Thursday weekly meetings, alternating in online and in-person.
    * Learned the responsibility of our group and what we are solving in the general scope of the problem. 
    * Learned the specific requirements of the project and the tech stack that is needed for it.

*Meeting #2*
* When and where
    * Was on Thursday, October 10th, 2019, and at the Bampot Tea House on Bathurst and Harbord. The meeting was approximately 2 hours in length. 
* What we discussed during the meeting
    * Retrieved the necessary hardware needed to test our code. Specifically, the cameras, the Raspberry Pi, and any wiring/components associated.
    * Showed our partner the answers for the deliverable questions to see if they correctly aligned with his vision.
    * Discussed our user stories and possible others that we may add.
    * Asked questions relating to training, models, and general questions relating to the whole project.
* The outcomes of the meeting
    * Obtained the hardware relating to the project and discussed how to use it.
    * Got input from our partner with his edits on what our questions portrayed wrongly and got his additions as well.
    * Discussed our plan of action after having doubts relating to particular issues with our original plan.

#### Artifacts

* Zenhub will be used to keep track of what needs to get done and will be used to assign tasks to team members.  Zenhub is a free AGILE project management application directly on Github.
* We will prioritize tasks by when they are due / need to be displayed.
* We will create a schedule using google docs or something similar to manage when all project deadlines should be due.

#### Deployment and Github Workflow

Describe your Git / GitHub workflow. Essentially, we want to understand how your team members shares a codebase, avoid conflicts and deploys the application.

 * Be concise, yet precise. For example, "we use pull-requests" is not a precise statement since it leaves too many open questions - Pull-requests from where to where? Who reviews the pull-requests? Who is responsible for merging them? etc.
 * If applicable, specify any naming conventions or standards you decide to adopt.
 * Describe your overall deployment process from writing code to viewing a live applicatioon
 * What deployment tool(s) are you using and why
 * Don't forget to **explain why** you chose this workflow or particular aspects of it!
 
## Product

#### Goals and tasks

 * Describe your goals for this iteration and the tasks that you will have to complete in order to achieve these goals.
 * Order the items from most to least important.
 * Feel free (but not obligated) to specify some/all tasks as user stories.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

 * Artifacts can be text, code, images, videos, interactive mock-ups and/or any other useful artifact you can think of.
 * Make sure to explain the purpose of each artifact (i.e. Why is it on your to-do list? Why is it useful for your team?)
 * Be concise, yet precise.         
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.
