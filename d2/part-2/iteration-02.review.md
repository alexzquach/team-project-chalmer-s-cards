# Chalmers Vision - Team 700 IQ

## Iteration 2 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Thursday, November 14th, 2019
 * Where: Bahen Centre for Information Technology, room 3185

## Process - Reflection

After working through the project and doing a review meeting, it was found that many of our more optimistic team decisions (like using artifacts to keep track of AGILE meetings) turned out to be either too much work for the team or not helpful with the process of developing our product.  Our issues and the impact of each decision we made before developing our product are discussed below

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.


 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped
1) Using Zenhub (one of our artifacts) to keep track of what needs to get done  
* This did not turn out as well as we hoped because when doing the actual project work, it turned out that our members had a lot of other work to tend to as well so we did not find enough time to update zenhub after our Agile meetings
2) Creating a schedule to manage project deadlines (one of our artifacts)
* This did not turn out as well as we hoped because we found that we did not actually need to schedule our tasks as our team members seemed to work really well without it.
3) Trying to explicitly seperate types of models for our product
* This did not turn out as well as we hoped because after doing proper research, it turns out that many models share the same type of AI techniques and object detection techniques, so seperating each model by "type" turned out to be unnecessary and undoable.


#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why you are making a change.


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * Refer/link to artifact(s) that show that a goal/task was met/completed.
 * If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.      
   e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?

#### How was your product demo?
 * How did you prepare your demo?
 * What did you manage to demo to your partner?
 * Did your partner accept the features?
 * Were there change requests?
 * What did you learn from the demo from either a process or product perspective?

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * 2 - 4 items
 * Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)
 * High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.
 * These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.
 * Can be related to product and/or process.
