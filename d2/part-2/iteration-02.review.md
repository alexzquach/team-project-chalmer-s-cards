# Chalmers Vision - Team 700 IQ

## Iteration 2 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Thursday, November 14th, 2019
 * Where: Bahen Centre for Information Technology, room 3185

## Process - Reflection

After working through the project and doing a review meeting, it was found that many of our more optimistic team decisions (like using artifacts to keep track of AGILE meetings) turned out to be either too much work for the team or not helpful with the process of developing our product.  We also had many process decisions that turned out to be much more helpful and less tedious than expected.  Our issues and the impact of each decision we made before developing our product are discussed below

#### Decisions that turned out well
1) Weekly meetings with our project partner  
This turned out to be very very successful because our project partner gave us weekly insight to resources, gave useful feedback and support, and gave valuable knowledge of the industry we are working for.  It was expected that weekly meetings might be a lot of work and time but they turned out to be the most valuable part of the process for many of our group members.  The constant feedback from our partner allowed us to succeed the most given the unique nature of our product.

2) Paired programming groups  
Although the specified groups merged to create two larger groups, the "paired programming" aspect turned out to be very successful because of the nature of our project.  The paired programming allowed each group to succeed because it allowed for the simultaneous coding and researching of models in each individual group.  The large paired programming groups also allowed for a seemless testing process of each model as members could code and test at the same time.  It also saved a lot of time in the long run as there is not much code to write for each model (more research based) and there was not much conflict when merging branches/repos.
2) The group chats created worked out well  
These turned out to be successful because our group needed a place to just discuss the project and the facebook group chat turned out to be perfect and more professional than expected.  It also helped us communicate at anytime during the day because most of our group checks messenger the most out of all their chatting applications which allowed quick response rates.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped
1) Using Zenhub (one of our artifacts) to keep track of what needs to get done  
This did not turn out as well as we hoped because when doing the actual project work, it turned out that our members had a lot of other work to tend to as well so we did not find enough time to update zenhub after our Agile meetings
2) Creating a schedule to manage project deadlines (one of our artifacts)
 This did not turn out as well as we hoped because we found that we did not actually need to schedule our tasks as our team members seemed to work really well without it.
3) Trying to explicitly seperate types of models for our product
This did not turn out as well as we hoped because after doing proper research, it turns out that many models share the same type of AI techniques and object detection techniques, so seperating each model by "type" turned out to be unnecessary and undoable.


#### Planned changes
1) Less Agile meetups  
We are changing this because we feel like they dont help the process as much as they should.  We as a group would prefer more time to actually work on the product as there is not much to talk about with our development.
2) No agile artifacts  
We as a team worked well without them in the first place.

(Everything else seemed to work well)



## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:
1) Goal 1) was met and completed.  Two computer vision models were completed.  Each pair programming group completed one model each and both seemed to detect and track human bodies to the standard we needed.  Both models are on the github repo in their respective files / branches.

2) Goals 2) and 3) were met and completed by paired programming group 1) and was demonstrated to our project partner successfully.  This model is again on the github repo.

3) Tasks 1-5 were met and completed by both paired programming groups as one group 1) figured out all 3 goals, group 2) was able to learn how to implement in their model (although, not completely implemented by group 2) yet at the end of D2)

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

1) Goals 2 and 3 were not completed by paired programming group 2 as group 1 already figured out the implenttion of both goals and finished the implementation of their model. We figured that for our partner presentation, only one model that worked decently well was enough and it turned out to be true as our partner was pleased with our work so far.  There was also not enough time to get to it.  More preperation was put into the presentation with our partner to make up for the lack of two different models.


#### How was your product demo?
* To prepare for our demo, we recorded some short demo videos of us walking in and out of a "shelter" which consisted of us walking across the screen to simulate us walking in and out of a shelter.
* We managed to demo to our partner a working model that had a counter displaying the amount of people who have walked in and out of the screen.  We used both prerecorded videos and a laptop webcam to demonstrate the strengths of our model.
* The partner was very happy with our product and was proud of our progress.  He accepted the features we had and he was pleased that we made significant progress (mentioning we made more progress than his own work)
 * There were no change requests from our partner.  However, the partner mentioned a couple of tips that could improve our model which were using a black and white background and thermal background / filter for our model / camera.
 * From the demo, we learned how to properly demonstrate a work-in-progress model to our partner.  We learned how to explain and demonstrate the basic features as requested by our partner.

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * 2 - 4 items
 * Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)
 * High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.
 * These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.
 * Can be related to product and/or process.
