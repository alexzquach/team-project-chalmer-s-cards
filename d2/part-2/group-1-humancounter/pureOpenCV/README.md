This project simply runs face recognition on an input video. The video is hardcoded in the python file, but one can change the input video.

***Setup***
1. First install OpenCV
pip3 install opencv-python
2. Install face_recognition
pip install dlib
pip install face_recognition

***How to Run***
python face_detector.py

We don't think we will pursue this option to do people-counting. But this project just demonstrates our steps to getting to the people-counting implementation we have right now. We can also fall back on this project if necessary.
