This project simply runs face recognition on an input video. The video is hardcoded in the python file, but one can change the input video.
This project uses face-recognition to detect faces. We did not end up pursuing this route, because face-detection was more efficient for people-counting. We include this project in d2, because we may use it in the future. 

***Setup***
1. First install OpenCV
pip3 install opencv-python
2. Install face_recognition
pip install dlib
pip install face_recognition

***How to Run***
python face_detector.py
