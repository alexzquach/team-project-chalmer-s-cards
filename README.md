### Additional notes:
1) Extension to Saturday, November 16, 2019 was given by TA Adam during tutorial on Tuesday, November 12, 2019 at 12:50 PM.  Adam was also emailed reminding him of the extension
2) We will be working in project groups / "paired" programming groups as our project is quite unique in the sense that not much code will have to be pushed.  Instead of coding a lot like the ordinary group, we have more research to do as we have to find viable models that will work for our project and figure out how to use these models.  Using the models won't require much coding like writing an app would.  TA Adam was also notified through email asking if it was okay and it was approved. 
The groups are as follow:  
* Group 1: Brian, Saim, Rooney
* Group 2: Frederick, Alex, Jimmy, Zuhab    
In total, there will be two/three models completed by these two groups for deliverable 2
