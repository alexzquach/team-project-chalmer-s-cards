# Counting Research
The work done provided in the google drive link below (due to the fact to the work being too large, we put it on an external site so it does not bloat up the repo) is an attempt at counting methods rather than object tracking.  It was found that we need some sort of tracking to properly count human bodies entering and leaving and thus, this attempt / research died.

Problems: Cannot distinguish people entering and leaving, thus wont work.
